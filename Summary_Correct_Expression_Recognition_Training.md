The provided code can be divided into the following sections:

1. Data Extraction and Setup:
   - Downloading a zip file and extracting its contents.
   - Importing necessary libraries and setting random seed.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Creating Path objects for training and testing data directories.
   - Obtaining image paths and labels from the training data.
   - Encoding labels using LabelEncoder and converting them to categorical format.
   - Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
   - Computing class weights based on the training labels.

3. Data Transformation and Dataset Creation:
   - Defining a function for image loading and transformation.
   - Setting image size and batch size.
   - Defining basic transformations (resizing) and data augmentation techniques.
   - Creating a function to generate TensorFlow Dataset objects from image paths and labels.

4. Visualization and Data Inspection:
   - Displaying a sample training image and its label.
   - Displaying a sample validation image and its label.

5. Model Architecture:
   - Building the EfficientNetB2 model as a sequential model.
   - Adding necessary layers for global average pooling, dropout, and dense classification.
   - Compiling the model with optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

6. Model Training:
   - Training the model on the training dataset.
   - Specifying the number of epochs, validation data, and class weights.
   - Setting up callbacks for model checkpointing and early stopping.

7. Testing Phase:
   - Creating a new instance of the EfficientNetB2 model.
   - Compiling the model with the same optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
   - Loading the best weights obtained during training.
   - Creating a test dataset using test image paths and labels.
   - Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.

8. Saving Objects:
   - Saving the trained model and the label encoder object using pickle.

Each section serves a specific purpose in the overall workflow of extracting data from the web, preprocessing it, training a model, and evaluating its performance.
